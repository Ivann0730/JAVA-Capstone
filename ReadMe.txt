Why and How

We are a group of four students who loves playing RPG games. We’ve always enjoyed pixel-art games like Soul Knight
because of their exciting action, colorful designs, and fun gameplay. This was the bases of our game.
But instead of creating something as complex as Soul Knight, we decided to keep things simple—something easier
for a small team like ours to make but still fun and enjoyable.

That’s how DannyGerman: The Bugged World. It’s our version of a 2D pixel RPG with exploration,
battles, and a great story. We used the skills we’ve been learning as students to make it. Our goal was to create a
game that’s easy to play, feels nostalgic, and is fun for everyone who loves pixel RPGs as much as we do.

Story Line
The game begins with the protagonist, Dannygerman, awakening in the middle of a mysterious and glitch-riddled forest. The vibrant world around him seems
off—trees flicker between reality and code, and the air hums with an odd digital energy. By his side is his quirky and loyal companion,
Radley the Radish Together, they must uncover the secrets of this broken world.

Act 1: Meeting the Stranger
As Dannygerman and Radley explore the forest, they encounter a hooded man known only as The Guide, who seems to understand the strange
glitches plaguing the land. The Guide offers cryptic advice and teaches them the art of farming slime, Green slimes provide basic resources,
blue slimes yield incredible defense, while red slimes hold the key to fast speed.
Act 2: Leveling Up

Under The Guide’s mentorship, Dannygerman and Radley establish a small base in the forest, honing their farming skills.
As they gather resources and defeat slimes, they unlock powerful new abilities and upgrade their gear.
The forest gradually reveals hidden areas with treasures, puzzles, and even more challenging slime variants.

Act 3: The Call to the Dungeon
Once they’ve reached a certain level of strength, The Guide reveals the existence of a massive dungeon,
said to be the heart of the world's corruption. It’s here that the true danger lies. The dungeon is filled with mobs of glitched creatures,
each more dangerous and bizarre than the last.

Act 4: Confronting the Dungeon
Inside the dungeon, Dannygerman faces off against mobs like Spiders, Orcs,
and ETC. Each floor presents increasing difficulty, environmental hazards,
and mind-bending puzzles that exploit the "bugged" nature of the world.
At the end of each dungeon level, bosses guard the way forward, such as:

Act 5: The Truth Behind the Bugged World
As Dannygerman ventures deeper into the dungeon, fragmented memories and
glitchy echoes reveal the chilling truth. The bugged world was not a mere accident
but a carefully orchestrated trap by Radley the Radish—his seemingly loyal companion all along.

Final Act: The Battle for Freedom
The final boss, Radley the Radish, awaits at the core of the dungeon. It’s an epic battle requiring all the skills,
gear, and knowledge gained throughout the journey. With the help of Radley and the lessons from The Guide,
Dannygerman must defeat Radley the Radish and restore balance to the simulation.
