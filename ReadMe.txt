Why and How

We are a group of four students who loves playing RPG games. We’ve always enjoyed pixel-art games like Soul Knight
because of their exciting action, colorful designs, and fun gameplay. This was the bases of our game.
But instead of creating something as complex as Soul Knight, we decided to keep things simple—something easier
for a small team like ours to make but still fun and enjoyable.

That’s how DannyGerman: The Bugged World. It’s our version of a 2D pixel RPG with exploration,
battles, and a great story. We used the skills we’ve been learning as students to make it. Our goal was to create a
game that’s easy to play, feels nostalgic, and is fun for everyone who loves pixel RPGs as much as we do.
